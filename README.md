# Technical Analysis

Build trading strategy to maximize profit based on the past behaviour of a stock price.

See [Insturctions notebook](instructions.ipynb) for details.

Developed by Konstantin Spirin for CodeIT Suisse 2019.

TODO:

- Increase complexity to 10
- Add .txt extension to readme in sample_data.zip to be able to open on Windows
- Handle timeouts
- Log model parameters
- (maybe) Add solution running time to message
- Add code snippet to generate data and an empty solver
- Add "Challenge" to instructions page title
- (maybe not) Move sample input to "input section" in instructions page
- Mention model parameters in instructions and add them to inspiration visualization titles
- (maybe) Think about how to reformulate "sull index range"
- Add axis labels on the first illustration
- Check sample_data.zip can be opened on Windows and contains README
- Test in both HK and SG
- Create evaluator notebook
- Script to clone all repos from heroku?
- How to avoid committing generated zip and html but still have them on Heroku?
- ✓ Add instructions page link to confluence
- ✓ Add link to zip into instructions
- ✓ Generate more training data
- ✓ ! First image is not rendered on instructions page
- ✓ Include content into non-200 errors
- ✓ Instructions page title should mention "Technical Analysis"
- ✓ Problem visualization at the beginning?
- ✓ CPU resources for solvers - they host wherever they want
- ✓ Hide code on instructions page
- ✓ Add timeout information on instructions page
- ✓ Document that score_i is never less than 0
- ✓ Document "ceil" in scoring in instructions
- ✓ Add smaller sample to the instructions page
- ✓ Check solution return code and return 0 to cooridnator on exception
- ✓ Fix failing production test submission
- ✓ Check max message size and exclude optimal trades
- ✓ What does evaluate callback return? (see logs) - empty body
